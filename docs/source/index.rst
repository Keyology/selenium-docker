Selenium-Docker is a glue library that combines the functionality of Docker
and Selenium using gevent. Its primary aim is to be a reliable drop-in
replacement for traditional Selenium testing by hiding the browser windows
and enabling advanced features such as screen recording and automatic proxy
caching.
